# Overview

The Calendar widget allows to view a list of cases in a calendar view. The component supports the following functionality:

- 3 types of views are supported by default: Monthly, Weekly and Daily - Weekly and Daily shows an hour timeline whereas Monthly only show the day.
- Monthly view render the appointment as large card with field values whereas Weekly and Daily only render the title of the appointment (pyLabel)
- For hourly views - the range is from 7 AM to 7 PM - this is not configurable but could easily be exposed as settings
- The widget will listen to filter change on the UI (change month, view...) - it will persist the context in localstorage and on load of the UI, it will use the context from the localstorage if present - this allows to navigate between pages but maintain the selected view
- The widget will listen to ASSIGNMENT_SUBMISSION event from the Constellation runtime - if the case is edited using the preview panel, the calendar data will be refreshed automatically

Each case must expose the properties: SessionDate, StartTime and EndTime.
The widget is configured by passing a list Data page that provides all the instances of this case type.
Another parameter called 'Create case className' will show the 'create' button if this parameter is set and let you create new case directly from the calendar.
